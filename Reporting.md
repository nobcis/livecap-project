# Livecap Reports #

Livecap provides a means to view a live capture report in a visually appealing way via a web browser. Specify the folder in which you want to store your report in the serverconfig.txt file. The report directory must be the first entry in the file. A new folder is created for each machine investigated and one each new day of invetigation. The main report is called forensiclog.html. In addition, there are also text based files that contain the raw command outputs of commands that were run on the compromised machine.
